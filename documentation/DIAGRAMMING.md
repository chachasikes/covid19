# System Diagrams
Some notes about how the application works which we can port into a diagram once we understand.

Some workflows we discussed documenting:
1. How a new page is created and published.
2. How a page slug can be changed.
3. How the different actions and APIs work together.
4. What is the build process? (Can we optimize it to speed it up?)
