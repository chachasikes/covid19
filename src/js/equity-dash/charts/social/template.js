    <p>Californians in crowded housing or transportation, and with less access to paid leave and other worker protections have a higher risk of infection of COVID-19. Social determinants of health, such as food insecurity, lack of health insurance, and housing instability can increase the risk of poor outcomes. These social determinants of health are often the result of structural racism.</p>
